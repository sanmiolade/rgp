# Rengenpect
RenGenPECT was developed as a resource to host integrated molecular, environmental, clinical and sociodemographic data for renal disease. This resource aims to collate and share validated, carefully curated information that will facilitate future international research initiatives. We are currently building this resource, which will be live in 2021.

The project is led by  **Prof AJ McKnight** and her fellow team of CKD researchers. The portal is maintained by Dr. Sanmi Olade who is thankful for the opportunity to be a part of the team.
